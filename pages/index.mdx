# Fulton Browne

Hey! I'm a software enthusiast and computer science student at Samford University.
My goal is to use computers and software to help make the world a better place.
I have a particular passion for AI, LISP, and obsure operationg systems and I'm always on the look out for more of those types of projects.
If any of that interest you check out my blog or socials below.
